The LightBurn project file is set for 3mm plywood boards, adjust to your liking if using other materials.\
Depending on the power settings on your cutter there might be scorch marks or splintered fragments which can be sanded off for aesthetics as well as better allignment of the enclosure pieces.
The enclosure pieces are cut in puzzle shape so they lock with each other in a cohesive manner.
This enclosure is made with multiples in mind, so a numbering system based off Pokemon in Pokedex ordering is used. For example, the first enclosure has a number of 001 corresponding to Bulbasaur for ease of identification on boards (and for v i b e s).\
It is recommended to apply a protective wood sealant to the pieces to avoid warping from humidity and protect against external damage.\

1. The piece with the Pokemon and number is the base of the enclosure and it will be face-downin assembly. Have all edge pieces laid next to the base piece like the image below.
2. Attach the sides of the enclosure by attaching the side pieces to the base piece vertically. Theedges of the pieces should interlock with adjacent edges of other pieces.
3. Orientation of the pieces with holes matters. The front side of the enclosure is the piece with 8 holes for the audio ports, while the back are for the USB connection to the PCB and power supply.
4. The front side is not symmetrical, so orient the piece so that the holes are slightly raised. The back side needs to be rotated so that the power supply hole is on the rear right side of the enclosure (with the front side facing you like in the second image).
5. Place the top cover of the enclosure oriented so that the numbers are on the bottom and correspond with the holes on the front side. Confirm positioning with the last image.

*IMPORTANT:* Ensure the PCB is inside the enclosure before closing it or gluing. 
Put the knob caps on the potentiometers after the enslosure has been glued. 
Remove the top side of the enclosure, as the PCB is not in the enclosure yet.
Apply wood glue to the edges of the pieces that are interlocking to secure them together and sand off any excess.
